# 8-3 Journal (CS-360-13254)
>[!NOTE]
>This repository contains artifacts from my final project submission in Module 7 in CS-360 at SNHU. Files include a zip of the source files from the Android Studio project (and signed APK), a Word document containing my "App Launch Plan," and a folder of screenshots to sample each of the required functions of the application.
## Inventorio

* **Requirements and goals of the app:**  
  The goal of Inventorio was to create a simple inventory management tool that lets users add, edit, and remove items while keeping track of key details like item name, quantity, and description. The app was designed for small-scale users—students, hobbyists, or small businesses—who need a straightforward way to manage and track their inventory without complicated enterprise-level features.

* **Screens and features for user needs:**  
  The app included a login screen for secure access, a main inventory list for browsing items, and detail views for adding or updating inventory entries. I kept the UI minimal and clean, relying on recognizable design patterns like bottom navigation and straightforward forms. These choices were made so users could focus on the content (their items) instead of fighting the interface. The designs were successful because they prioritized clarity and ease of use, which is exactly what someone managing inventory on a phone would need.

* **Approach to coding:**  
  I broke down the app into manageable parts—first building out the layout and navigation, then adding functionality to each screen. I leaned on modular code and kept features loosely coupled so they could be extended later without rewriting the whole thing. This strategy made the process more efficient and less overwhelming. It’s a good habit for any future project since modular, readable code is easier to maintain and adapt.

* **Testing and ensuring functionality:**  
  I tested by running the app on an emulator and checking each user flow: logging in, adding items, editing them, and deleting them. I also paid attention to edge cases like leaving fields blank or entering invalid data. This process mattered because it confirmed the app worked as expected and highlighted small bugs before they could frustrate a user. Testing revealed that some layouts needed tweaks on different screen sizes, which I was able to fix early.

* **Innovation and challenges:**  
  The biggest challenge was making the UI both flexible and consistent across different device sizes. To overcome this, I leaned on constraint-based layouts and reusable components. That way, the interface didn’t break when moving from one screen size to another. This was less about flashy innovation and more about applying practical problem-solving to a common mobile design challenge.

* **Strongest demonstration of skills:**  
  I was most successful in demonstrating my understanding of user-centered design within the inventory list and detail views. These components showed my ability to connect user needs with clean, functional UI design while also tying in the underlying logic to make them work. It was a good intersection of both design thinking and technical implementation.

### Reflection 
Working through Inventorio from proposal to launch plan gave me a full picture of what goes into mobile app development beyond just writing code. I had to think about user needs, usability, scalability, and even how the app would be presented in the marketplace. This process reinforced the importance of building with the end user in mind while still maintaining solid technical practices. More than anything, I learned that thoughtful planning and small iterative steps make tackling larger projects much more manageable.
